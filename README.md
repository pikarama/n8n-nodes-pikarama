## Pikarama Trigger

The **Pikarama Trigger** node lets you receive real-time webhook events from Pikarama. When you activate a workflow, it automatically registers a webhook with Pikarama. When deactivated, it removes the webhook.

### Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Event Created** | Fires when a new event or poll is created |
| **Event Closed** | Fires when an event is completed (winner chosen) |
| **Vote Cast** | Fires when someone votes |
| **Submission Added** | Fires when someone submits a pick |

### Filter by Groups

Optionally filter events to specific groups:

1. Enable **Filter by Groups**
2. Select one or more groups from the dropdown
3. Only events from those groups will trigger the workflow

Leave empty to receive events from all your groups.

### Webhook Signature Verification

All webhook payloads are signed with HMAC-SHA256. The trigger node automatically verifies the `X-Pikarama-Signature` header to ensure payloads are authentic.

### Recurring Event Fields

When an event is created by a recurring schedule (Plus/Pro plans), the payload includes additional fields:

```json
{
  "event": "event.created",
  "data": {
    "event": {
      "id": "abc123",
      "name": "Friday Movie Night",
      "status": "submitting",
      "is_recurring": true,
      "schedule_id": "sch-456",
      "recurrence_cron": "0 18 * * 5",
      "event_time": "2026-03-07T18:00:00Z",
      "submission_deadline": "2026-03-07T17:00:00Z",
      "voting_deadline": "2026-03-07T18:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Use `is_recurring` to detect scheduled events vs manually created ones.

### Example: Create Calendar Event from Recurring Pikarama Event

1. **Pikarama Trigger** → Events: "Event Created"
2. **IF Node** → Condition: `{{ $json.data.event.is_recurring }}` equals `true`
3. **Google Calendar Node**:
   - Summary: `{{ $json.data.event.name }}`
   - Start: `{{ $json.data.event.event_time }}`
   - Description: "Pikarama decision time! Submit your picks."

### Example: Notify Slack When Event Completes

1. **Pikarama Trigger** → Events: "Event Closed"
2. **Slack Node** → Send message: "🎉 Winner: {{ $json.data.winner.title }}"
